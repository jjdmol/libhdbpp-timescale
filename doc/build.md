# Build Instructions

To build the shared library please read the following.

## Dependencies

The project has two types of dependencies, those required by the toolchain, and those to do the actual build. Other dependencies are integrated directly into the project as submodules. The following thirdparty modules exists:

* spdlog - Logging system (Submodule)
* Catch2 - Unit test subsystem (Submodule)
* libhdbpp - Header from the hdb++ library loading chain (Modified version of [original](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/libhdbpp) project. This will be pushed back to the original repository in time)

### Toolchain Dependencies

If wishing to build the project, ensure the following dependencies are met:

* CMake 3.6 or higher
* C++14 compatible compiler (code base is using c++14)

### Build Dependencies

Ensure the development version of the dependencies are installed. These are as follows:

* Tango Controls 9 or higher development headers and libraries
* omniORB release 4 or higher development headers and libraries
* libzmq3-dev or libzmq5-dev
* libpq-dev or libpqxx - Postgres C development library, to build libpqxx, or directly libpqxx version 6.4

## Building and Installation

To compile this library, first ensure it has been recursively cloned so all submodules are present in /thirdparty. The build system uses pkg-config to find some dependencies, for example Tango. If Tango is not installed to a standard location, set PKG_CONFIG_PATH, i.e.

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/non/standard/tango/install/location
```

Then to build just the library:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The pkg-config path can also be set with the cmake argument CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. This can be set on the command line at configuration time, i.e.:

```bash
...
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/non/standard/tango/install/location ..
...
```

## Build Flags

The following build flags are available

### Standard CMake Flags

The following is a list of common useful CMake flags and their use:

| Flag | Setting | Description |
|------|-----|-----|
| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX | PATH | Standard CMake flag to modify the install prefix. |
| CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH | PATH[S] | Standard CMake flag to add include paths to the search path. |
| CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH | PATH[S] | Standard CMake flag to add paths to the library search path |
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | Debug/Release | Build type to produce |

### Project Flags

| Flag | Setting | Default | Description |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| BUILD_UNIT_TESTS | ON/OFF | OFF | Build unit tests |
| BUILD_BENCHMARK_TESTS | ON/OFF | OFF | Build benchmark tests (Forces a Release build) |
| ENABLE_CLANG | ON/OFF | OFF | Clang code static analysis, readability, and cppcore guideline enforcement |

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

The project has extensive unit tests to ensure its functioning as expect. Build the project with testing enabled:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=ON ..
make
```

To run all unit tests, a postgresql database node is required with the project schema loaded up. There is a default connection string inside test/TestHelpers.hpp:

```
user=postgres host=localhost port=5432 dbname=hdb password=password
```

If you run the hdb timescale docker image associated with this project locally then this will connect automatically. If you wish to use a different database, edit the string in test/TestHelpers.hpp.

To run all tests:

```bash
./test/unit-tests
```

To look at the available tests and tags, should you wish to run a subset of the test suite (for example, you do not have a postgresql node to test against), then tests and be listed:

```bash
./bin/unit-tests --list-tests
```

Or:

```bash
./bin/unit-tests --list-tags
```

To see more options for the unit-test command line binary:

```bash
./bin/unit-tests --help
```

### Benchmark Tests

These are a work in progress to explore future optimisation point. If built, they can be run as follows:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARK_TESTS=ON ..
make
```

```bash
./benchmark/benchmark-tests
```
