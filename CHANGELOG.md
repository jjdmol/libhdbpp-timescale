## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Moved some system documentation to hdbpp-timescale-project (the consolidated project).
- Consolidated remaining build/install instructions into README
- Modified build system to use fetch libhdbpp and include it when requested. This is an aid to development.
- Supported LIBHDBPP_PROJECT_BUILD flag, that is injected into the build from hdbpp-timescale-project
- Made compatible with new libhdbpp (namespace, function and path changes)

### Removed

- Removed the embedded version of libhdbpp (the build can now source it at build time)

## [0.11.2] - 2020-01-23

### Fixed

- Incremented version number in CMakeLists.txt

## [0.11.1] - 2020-01-22

### Fixed

- Fix potential crash in AttributeName::tangoHostWithDomain() [#8](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/libhdbpp-timescale/pull/8)

## [0.11.0] - 2020-01-21

### Added

- Added support for time to live feature. 

### Changed

- Excluded large parts of PqxxExtension.hpp from liniting (since it conforms to pqxx coding standards)

## [0.10.0] - 2019-12-06

### Added

- Configuration documentation 
- Added support for syslog logging.
- Added support for storing data via insert strings rather than prepared statements:
  - Tango string spectrum types are always stored via insert strings to remove escape characters

- All unit tests now pass!

### Changed

- Completely redone DbConnectionTest unit tests
  - Speeds up execution of tests
  - Prevents database deadlock due to repeated rapid truncation of tables.

- Corrected static library build
- Install now places header in include/hdb++/
- Entire library now uses the global default logger from spdlog.
- Updated spdlog submodule to release v1.4.2
- Modern code via clang tidy
- DbConnection::storeParameterEvent() no longer asserts on empty parameters, it now warns in the log.

## [0.9.1] - 2019-07-18

### Added

- Google benchmark sub-module for micro benchmarking. This will enabled future optimisation
  - Benchmark tests for QueryBuilder

### Fixed

- Fix to build system - can build without Clang enabled now.
- Updates/corrections to docs

## [0.9.0] - 2019-07-12
